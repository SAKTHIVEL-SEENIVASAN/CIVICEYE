🎯 Problem Statement

Current civic reporting apps (e.g., Namma Salai, Indore 311) have major gaps:

Fake closures with no accountability

No AI-powered prioritisation or insights

No offline/multilingual support

Low citizen engagement

👉 Our Goal: Build a robust civic issue reporting platform with AI, Blockchain, and Offline-first support to ensure trust, speed, and resolution.

💡 Proposed Solution

✅ Real-time issue reporting (photo, voice, auto-location)
✅ AI-powered urgency & cost estimation
✅ Blockchain-backed immutable logging
✅ Citizen gamification for engagement
✅ Offline-first + multilingual complaint support
✅ Centralised dashboard with live maps

🛠️ Tech Stack

React.js + ShadCN → Web Portal (admin/staff)

Backend

Django REST Framework / Node.js

PostgreSQL + PostGIS

AI/ML

YOLOv8 → Potholes, garbage, streetlights detection

IndicBERT → Multilingual NLP complaint processing

OpenCV + CLIP → Duplicate/fake photo check

TensorFlow/PyTorch → Urgency & cost prediction

Infrastructure

Docker, AWS S3, Redis, RabbitMQ

Blockchain

Hyperledger Fabric → Immutable issue logging

Notifications & Analytics

Firebase, WhatsApp API, Power BI dashboards

📊 Competitive Analysis
| Existing App     | Features                       | Gaps Identified                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Namma Salai (TN) | Pothole reporting, repair logs | No AI insights, fake closures           |
| Indore 311       | Smart City complaint portal    | No offline mode, lacks multilingual NLP |


⚖️ Feasibility Analysis

Technical → AI/ML models proven, modular, scalable backend

Economic → Open-source + pay-as-you-go cloud infra

Operational → Simple UX for citizens + staff dashboards

Scalability → Ready for ward → city → state → national rollout

⚠️ Challenges & Mitigation
| Challenge     | Risk                          | Mitigation                            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Data Quality  | Blurry/incomplete reports     | AI preprocessing + multilingual input |
| Fake Closures | Dept. closing without action  | Blockchain + community verification   |
| Connectivity  | Rural low-internet            | Offline-first, auto-sync              |
| Govt Adoption | Resistance to digital systems | Pilot ward → prove ROI → expand       |
| Privacy       | Sensitive photos/locations    | Encryption + anonymization            |
| Citizen Use   | Low adoption                  | Gamification + WhatsApp/SMS           |
